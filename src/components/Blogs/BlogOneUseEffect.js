      <p className="article-body">
      <span className="purple">useEffect</span> is a <span className="purple">hook</span> in React that allows developers to execute side effects in function components. Side effects can be any code that affects the state of the application beyond the scope of the current function, such as fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, or subscribing to events. By using useEffect, developers can ensure that these effects are executed only when necessary, and avoid duplicating code or causing infinite loops.

The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a function and an array of dependencies. The function is executed after every render of the component, including the initial render. If the array of dependencies is provided, the function is only executed when one or more of the dependencies change between renders. This allows developers to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders and side effects. The dependencies can be any value, including state variables, props, and functions.
